Hi there! Welcome to "Adventure Shell".

What you're looking at right now is a 'shell', a program designed to let you, a computer user, interact with the operating system of your computer in a text console (no mice here).

The shell is thinly disguised as an adventure game in the style of "Zork". Most commands in the game map to real commands in a normal shell, but sanitized so you don't hurt yourself too much.

Even this 'sign' is just a text file named 'sign.txt', and 'read sign' is a wrapper around a system command. Don't worry about that for now, it will be revealed to you as you go along.

For now, ignore all that. Just explore and you'll pick up bits and pieces as you go.

When you're ready, type 'go down' to continue.
